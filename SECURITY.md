# Security Policy

GitProxy supports responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities and adheres to the [FINOS Security Vulnerabilities Policy](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/cve-responsible-disclosure). If you find something you believe to be a security issue in GitProxy, we encourage and appreciate your report. Please report the issue privately to the project maintainers using one of the following methods:

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- **GitHub Security Reports:** In order for the vulnerability reports to reach maintainers as soon as possible, the preferred way is to use the ["Report a vulnerability"](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/security/advisories) button under the "Security" tab of the associated GitHub project. This creates a private communication channel between the reporter and the maintainers.  
- **Email:** If you are unable to or have strong reasons not to use the GitHub Security vulnerability reporting feature, please email the maintainers and cc: [security@finos.org](mailto:security@finos.org) with a description of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Process

1. **Report the vulnerability privately** using one of the methods above. Do not create a public GitHub Issue or make any public reference to the vulnerability.
2. The project team will acknowledge receipt of your report and triage the issue. If a vulnerability is confirmed, the team will work with you to investigate and resolve it.
3. Once a fix is available, a release will be made and the vulnerability will be publicly disclosed in accordance with the [FINOS policy](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/cve-responsible-disclosure).
