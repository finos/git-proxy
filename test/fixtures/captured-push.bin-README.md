# Captured push data

The captured-push.bin file contains a single captured push request used to test push file parsing. It was captured by adding the following to the `exec` function in _src/proxy/processors/push-action/parsePush.ts_:

```typescript
fs.writeFileSync('./.tmp/captured-pack.bin', req.body);
```

The push that was captured was generated by checking out the git proxy repository (a second copy) and running the following in its root directory to generate changes to commit:

```bash
echo "New content for pack testing $(date)" > new-file.txt
echo "# Updated README $(date)" >> README.md
git add .
git commit -m "test: test commit for pack capture $(date)"
```

The commit was then pushed into a locally running copy of git proxy (where the committing user was added as a contributor to the git-proxy repo). The push is processed as normally and its body written to file by the above modification.
