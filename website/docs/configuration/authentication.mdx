description: How to customize authentication methods for UI login and API
---

GitProxy allows setting up various auth methods for both UI users, and the backend API. 

### Where to Configure Auth Methods

Auth methods can be configured in [proxy.config.json](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/proxy.config.json). The `authentication` array allows setting UI authentication, for user login and management purposes. The `apiAuthentication` array allows setting up an _optional_ authentication layer for extra API security.

### Default Configuration

By default, GitProxy has a **local** UI authentication method enabled. Although not particularly secure, this allows logging in with simple user/password combinations for signup and login.

### Supported Methods

#### UI Auth

Currently, GitProxy supports three differemt methods for user creation and login:
- Local
- ActiveDirectory
- OIDC

Each of these has its own specific config entry with necessary parameters for setting up the method.

#### API Auth

GitProxy also supports protecting API endpoints with extra auth layers. Currently, the only available method is JWT - but this can be easily extended to use your own methods such as GitHub login and more.

### Sample Configuration - UI

#### Active Directory

A default, empty setup for OIDC is already present in [proxy.config.json](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/proxy.config.json):

```json
{
  "type": "ActiveDirectory",
  "enabled": false,
  "adminGroup": "",
  "userGroup": "",
  "domain": "",
  "adConfig": {
    "url": "",
    "baseDN": "",
    "searchBase": ""
  }
},
```

#### OIDC

A default, empty setup for OIDC is already present in [proxy.config.json](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/proxy.config.json). You can fill this in with your required parameters. Here's an example using Google as a login provider:

```json
"authentication": [
  {
    "type": "openidconnect",
    "enabled": true,
    "oidcConfig": {
      "issuer": "https://accounts.google.com",
      "clientID": "<client-id>",
      "clientSecret": "<client-secret>",
      "callbackURL": "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/oidc/callback",
      "scope": "email profile"
    }
  }
],
```

Notice that the `callbackURL` (`<ui-host-url>/api/auth/oidc/callback`) must be set both in your provider and this config file for the flow to work.

### Sample Configuration - API

#### JWT

JWT auth is ideal for using the GitProxy API along with CI tools and automation. It allows verifying credentials and admin permissions to use GitProxy securely in scripts, CI/CD pipelines and more.

You will need an existing OIDC setup to release valid JWT tokens.

**Warning: GitProxy does not provide/release JWT tokens for API validation.** Your service (configured through `jwtConfig`) will have to do this on its own. For example, it could be an app that allows users to log in through Google, and releases a JWT `access_token` with a one hour expiry date.

If the `jwt` auth method is enabled in the config, you'll notice that UI requests are no longer working. This is expected since the endpoints require a valid JWT to proceed. Once the `Bearer: <your-JWT>` authorization header is added, you should be able to access the endpoints as usual.

##### JWT Role Mapping

JWT auth also allows authenticating to specific in-app roles by using JWT `claims`. In the following sample config, Google JWT tokens that contain the following `claim` (`name: "John Doe"`) will be assigned the in-app admin role:

```json
"apiAuthentication": [
  {
    "type": "jwt",
    "enabled": true,
    "jwtConfig": {
      "clientID": "<client-id>",
      "authorityURL": "https://accounts.google.com",
      "expectedAudience": "<expected-audience>",
      "roleMapping": {
        "admin": {
          "name": "John Doe"
        }
      }
    }
  }
],
```

In other words, your JWT token provider can define an arbitrary `claim` that can be mapped to any app role you want, such as `admin`, or a custom role such as `ci-only`. This allows for granular access control for automation solutions using GitProxy.

Note that if the `expectedAudience` is missing, it will be set to the client ID.

### Adding your own methods

You can add new UI auth methods by extending the [passport.js configuration file](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/src/service/passport/local.js) with your desired method. You'll have to define a module and then add it to the `authStrategies` map: 

```js
const local = require('./local');
const activeDirectory = require('./activeDirectory');
const oidc = require('./oidc');

const authStrategies = {
  local: local,
  activedirectory: activeDirectory,
  openidconnect: oidc,
};
```

Check out the files in [src/service/passport](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/src/service/passport) for examples on how to define the specific `configure()` functions for each method:
- [Local](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/src/service/passport/local.js)
- [ActiveDirectory](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/src/service/passport/activeDirectory.js)
- [OIDC](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/src/service/passport/oidc.js)
