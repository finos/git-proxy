Here's how to get setup for contributing to Git Proxy.

## Setup
The Git Proxy project relies on the following pre-requisites:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (16+)
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/) (8+)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or equivalent Git client. It must support HTTP/S.

Once you have the above tools installed & setup, clone the repository and run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This will install the full project's dependencies. Once complete, you can run the app locally:

```bash
$ npm run start  # Run both proxy server & dashboard UI
$ npm run server # Run only the proxy server
$ npm run client # Run only the UI
```

## Testing
<!-- Notes about testing methodology -->

## Configuration schema
The configuration for Git Proxy includes a JSON Schema ([`config.schema.json`](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/config.schema.json)) to define the expected properties used by the application. When adding new configuration properties to Git Proxy, ensure that the schema is updated with any new, removed or changed properties. See [JSON Schema docs for specific syntax](https://json-schema.org/docs).

When updating the configuration schema, you must also re-generate the reference doc used here on the site. To generate the reference documentation, [json-schema-for-humans](https://github.com/coveooss/json-schema-for-humans) is used to output the Markdown.

1. Install [json-schema-for-humans](https://github.com/coveooss/json-schema-for-humans?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) (requires Python)
2. Run `npm run gen-schema-doc`.
