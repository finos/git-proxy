GitProxy is a [FINOS](https://www.finos.org/) project. We welcome contributions from anyone in the community.

For developer setup, building, testing, and coding guidelines, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the repository.

## Contribution Process

1. **Check for existing issues** — search [open issues](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/issues) to see if someone is already working on what you have in mind.
2. **Open an issue** — if nothing exists, [create one](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/issues/new) describing the change and the problem it solves.
3. **Discuss** — respond to questions or suggestions from maintainers and other contributors.
4. **Fork & submit a PR** — prepare your contribution on a feature branch and open a pull request against `main`.

If this is your first open source contribution, the [first-contributions guide](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions#first-contributions) is a great starting point.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

All contributors must have a CLA on file with FINOS before pull requests can be merged. Review the FINOS [contribution requirements](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/contribution) and submit (or have your employer submit) the required CLA via [EasyCLA](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/easycla).

## Governance

The project is governed by the [Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/) and the FINOS [IP Policy](https://community.finos.org/assets/files/IP-Policy-fe5925025fc0a57b1cbed64f86b26a73.pdf), [Code of Conduct](https://www.finos.org/code-of-conduct), [Collaborative Principles](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/Collaborative-Principles.md), and [Community Meeting Procedures](https://community.finos.org/docs/journey/engage#meet-the-community).

### Roles

- **Contributor** — anyone who submits a contribution (code, issues, comments, documentation, media, or any combination).
- **Maintainer** — a Contributor who, by virtue of their contribution history, has been given write access to the repository and may merge approved contributions.
- **Lead Maintainer** — the project's interface with the FINOS team and Board. Responsible for communicating on behalf of the project and for ensuring the project is following FINOS policies and procedures.

### Contribution Rules

- All contributions **must** be submitted as pull requests, including contributions by Maintainers.
- All pull requests **must** be reviewed by a Maintainer (other than the contributor) before being merged.
- Pull requests for non-trivial contributions **must** remain open long enough for all Maintainers to review and comment.
- After the review period, if no Maintainer objects, any Maintainer **may** merge.
- If any Maintainer objects, the Maintainers **should** try to reach consensus through discussion. If consensus cannot be reached or the contribution is deemed inappropriate or otherwise unable to be accepted into the project, the pull request will be closed.

If a pull request is closed due to objections, the contributor may address the concerns and re-open it for review. We encourage contributors to engage in good faith with any feedback and to seek help from the community if needed. If a contributor feels that their contribution was unfairly rejected, they may request a review by the Maintainer team and/or raise the issue in the community meeting.

### Becoming a Maintainer

Any Contributor who has made a substantial contribution may apply (or be nominated) to become a Maintainer. Existing Maintainers approve nominations via the voting process above.
