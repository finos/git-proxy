Here's how to get setup for contributing to GitProxy.

## Setup
The GitProxy project relies on the following pre-requisites:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (20+)
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/) (8+)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or equivalent Git client. It must support HTTP/S.

Once you have the above tools installed & setup, clone the repository and run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This will install the full project's dependencies. Once complete, you can run the app locally:

```bash
$ npm run start  # Run both proxy server & dashboard UI
$ npm run server # Run only the proxy server
$ npm run client # Run only the UI
```

## Testing

Currently, we use Mocha and Chai for unit testing and Cypress for E2E testing. For more details on how to use these testing libraries, check out our [Testing documentation](testing).

### Patch coverage requirements

Newly introduced changes **must have over 80% unit test coverage**. This is enforced by our CI, and in practice, only few exceptions (such as emergency fixes) are allowed to skip this requirement. Make sure to add thorough unit tests to your PR to help reviewers approve your PR more quickly!

## Configuration schema
The configuration for GitProxy includes a JSON Schema ([`config.schema.json`](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/config.schema.json)) to define the expected properties used by the application. When adding new configuration properties to GitProxy, ensure that the schema is updated with any new, removed or changed properties. See [JSON Schema docs for specific syntax](https://json-schema.org/docs).

When updating the configuration schema, you must also re-generate the reference doc used here on the site. To generate the reference documentation, [json-schema-for-humans](https://github.com/coveooss/json-schema-for-humans) is used to output the Markdown.

1. Install [json-schema-for-humans](https://github.com/coveooss/json-schema-for-humans?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) (requires Python)
2. Run `npm run gen-schema-doc`.
