description: Ready to take Git Proxy for a test drive?
---

In this section, we will demonstrate the power 💪 of Git Proxy and how it works with a barebones & out-of-the-box demonstration using default configuration. Before we start, there are a few prerequisites:

### Prerequisites

#### 1. Fork Git Proxy

For demonstration purposes, we recommend forking [Git Proxy](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/fork) and then cloning the repository to your PC:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/git-proxy.git
```

#### 2. Create a simple configuration

Create a configuration file in a new folder (separate to your fresh clone) with the following `JSON`:

```json title="new-folder/proxy.config.json"
{
  "authorisedList": [
    {
      "project": "<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>",
      "name": "git-proxy",
      "url": "https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/git-proxy.git"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Running Git Proxy

Now that you've got the prerequisites in place, it's time to run Git Proxy and load the configuration file from your new folder:

```bash
npx --package=@finos/git-proxy@1.1.0 -- git-proxy --config ./proxy.config.json
```

To confirm Git Proxy is running successfully, you should see the following in your terminal:

```bash
Listening on 8000
Service Listening on 8080
```


### Introduce Git Proxy to your clone

Navigate into your test-bed repository (where you cloned your Git Proxy fork) on your PC:

```bash
cd ./git-proxy
```

By default the clone of your repository will communicate with GitHub. To change this, so that your local copy of the repository speaks with Git Proxy, run:

```bash
git remote -v
git remote set-url origin http://localhost:8000/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/git-proxy.git
git remote -v
```

:::note

SSH and HTTPS protocols are currently not supported. See [#27](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/issues/27) for more.

:::

### Make changes to the codebase

Open up the `README.md` and make a change to the file.

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "chore: update README.md"
```

### Push via Git Proxy

```bash
git push
```

Immediately after a push, you should receive a message in your terminal:

```bash
remote: Git Proxy has received your push 🎉
remote: ----------------------------------------------------------
remote:    Commit from | 000000
remote:     Commit to  | b12557
remote:        URL     | http://localhost:8080/requests/000000__b12557    
```

The push is now held in a suspended state by Git Proxy and requires [approval](/docs/get-started/authorize) before it can be pushed to the upstream repository on GitHub.


#### Managing credentials

Git Proxy will prompt the entry of your git credentials. These credentials are your GitHub username and a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). For the ability to push and pull code through Git Proxy, you will only require the `public_repo` scope.

Git Proxy will reprompt you for credentials each time you push. To automatically re-use your credentials, you can run:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain # MacOS

git config --global credential.helper manager # Windows

git config --global credential.helper store # Linux
```

:::info

Git Proxy **does not** use your Personal Access Token other than to authenticate with GitHub when pushing code. This is identical to the process of pushing code to a repository without Git Proxy installed.
