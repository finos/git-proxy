### What is GitProxy?

GitProxy deploys custom push protections and policies on top of Git. It is a highly configurable framework allowing developers and organizations to enforce push protections relevant to their developer workflow, security posture and risk appetite.

GitProxy is built with a developer-first mindset. By presenting simple-to-follow remediation instructions in the CLI/Terminal, it minimises the friction of use and adoption, and keeps developers focused on what matters; committing and pushing code.
