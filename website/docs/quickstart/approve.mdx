description: How to approve a push in Git Proxy
---

All pushes that flow through Git Proxy require an approval (authorisation). Until a push is approved, Git Proxy will block the commits from being sent to the upstream repository. To approve a push, you can use the REST API or web UI.

## Using the REST API

### Prerequisites

- [x] Proxy and REST API are running ([default behaviour](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/index.js))
- [x] Proxy and REST API are running on `localhost:8000` and `localhost:8080`, respectively
- [x] [Intercepting a push](/docs/quickstart/intercept) instructions have been followed and you've reached [Push via Git Proxy](/docs/quickstart/intercept#push-via-git-proxy)
- [x] [`curl`](https://curl.se/) is installed

### Instructions

#### 1. Find the tracking `ID`

Following on from [Push via Git Proxy](/docs/quickstart/intercept#push-via-git-proxy), a unique & shareable link is generated:

```
http://localhost:8080/admin/push/0000000000000000000000000000000000000000__79b4d8953cbc324bcc1eb53d6412ff89666c241f
```

The `ID` for your push corresponds to the last part of the URL:

```
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000__79b4d8953cbc324bcc1eb53d6412ff89666c241f
```

#### 2. Authenticate with the API

Use the default & auto-generated Git Proxy username & password credentials to obtain a cookie. The cookie value is saved to a file (`git-proxy-cookie`):

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -c git-proxy-cookie -X POST \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}' http://localhost:8080/auth/login
```

#### 3. Retrieve push with `ID` from database

Using the [cookie](/docs/quickstart/approve#2-authenticate-with-the-api) generated, execute a `GET` request to confirm that your push with `ID` exists in the database:

```bash
curl -I -b ./git-proxy-cookie http://localhost:8080/api/v1/push/${ID}
```

You should receive a `200 OK` in the response. If `ID` does not exist then you'll receive a `404` error.

#### 4. Approve the push with `ID`

Using the same [cookie](/docs/quickstart/approve#2-authenticate-with-the-api) again, send a `POST` command to approve the push:

```bash
curl -b ./git-proxy-cookie \
  -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/push/${ID}/authorise
```

#### 5. Re-push your code

Execute `git push` to send your approved code to the upstream repository:

```bash
$ git push
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 10 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 470 bytes | 470.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.
```

## Using the CLI

### Prerequisites

- Proxy and REST API are running ([default behaviour](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/index.js))
- The Git Proxy URL is configured via the GIT_PROXY_UI_HOST (defaults to `http://localhost`) and GIT_PROXY_UI_PORT (defaults to `8080`) environment variables. Note: this documentation assumes that Git Proxy UI is running on `http://git-proxy.com:8080`.
- [Intercepting a push](/docs/quickstart/intercept) instructions have been followed and you've reached [Push via Git Proxy](/docs/quickstart/intercept#push-via-git-proxy)

### Instructions

#### 1. Find the tracking `ID`

Following on from [Push via Git Proxy](/docs/quickstart/intercept#push-via-git-proxy), you'll receive a unique URL:

```
http://localhost:8080/requests/0000000000000000000000000000000000000000__79b4d8953cbc324bcc1eb53d6412ff89666c241f
```

The `ID` for your push corresponds to the last part of the URL:

```
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000__79b4d8953cbc324bcc1eb53d6412ff89666c241f
```

#### 2. Authenticate with the CLI

Use the default & auto-generated Git Proxy username & password credentials to authenticate and obtain a cookie. The cookie value is saved to a file (`git-proxy-cookie`):

```bash
$ npx -- @finos/git-proxy-cli login --username admin --password admin
Login "admin" <admin@place.com> (admin): OK
```

#### 3. Approve the push with `ID`

Use the commit `ID` to approve your push with the CLI:

```bash
$ npx -- @finos/git-proxy-cli authorise --id 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000__79b4d8953cbc324bcc1eb53d6412ff89666c241f
Authorise: ID: '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000__79b4d8953cbc324bcc1eb53d6412ff89666c241f': OK
```

#### 4. Re-push your code

Execute `git push` to send your approved code through Git Proxy to the upstream repository:

```bash
$ git push
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 10 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 470 bytes | 470.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.
```

#### 5. Log out

Clean up your connect cookie via logging out:

```bash
$ npx -- @finos/git-proxy-cli logout
Logout: OK
```

## Using the UI

### Prerequisites

- [x] Proxy and REST API are running ([default behaviour](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/blob/main/index.js))
- [x] Proxy and REST API are running on `localhost:8000` and `localhost:8080`, respectively
- [x] UI is running on `localhost:3000`

### Instructions

#### 1. Login as administrator

[Login](http://localhost:3000/login) to the dashboard. As the UI is running on port `3000`, the URL is:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/login
```

Fill in the form using the following credentials:

```
Username: admin
Password: admin
```

Once submitted, you should be logged in as administrator 💪

#### 2. Visit the shareable link

Following on from [Push via Git Proxy](/docs/quickstart/intercept#push-via-git-proxy), a unique & shareable link is generated:

```bash
remote: Git Proxy has received your push ✅
remote:
remote: 🔗 Shareable Link
remote: http://localhost:8080/admin/push/000000__b12557
```

Insert the URL directly into your web browser.

#### 3. Approve the push using the dashboard

Press the approve button and a modal will appear. Happy with the contents of the push? 🤗

In the modal, check the tickbox ✅ and press the approve button.

#### 4. Re-push your code

Execute `git push` to send your approved code to the upstream repository:

```bash
$ git push
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 10 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 470 bytes | 470.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.
```
