---

### Run from global install

Once you have followed the [installation](installation) steps, run:

```bash
git-proxy
```

To run GitProxy using the CLI:

```bash
git-proxy-cli
```

### Using [npx instead of npm](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/)

You can also install & run `git-proxy` and `git-proxy-cli` in two steps:

```bash
npx -- @finos/git-proxy
```

```bash
npx -- @finos/git-proxy-cli
```

If you use a proxy server to access `npm` then please note that you also need to configure your proxy for `npx` before running the above commands:

```bash
npx config set https-proxy <company-proxy-endpoint>
```
